 == Dataset of bimodal handwritten music symbols ==
 == Contact: jcalvo@dlsi.ua.es ==

The dataset is provided in text format. It consists of 10230 lines of

		<label>:<sequence>:<image>

where
	- label: string representing the label of the data set (eg. proportio_minor)
	- sequence: the path followed by the e-pen during the trace of the symbol. Each
			sequence contains a series of 2D points separated by semicolons.
			Each dimension of the point is separated by a comma. An example
			of sequence with 3 points:

				2.1238,-2.3007;3.3627,-2.1238;4.6016,-0.3540		

			Note that all points are relative to the first one.
	- image: the patch of the image under the bounding box of the trace. It has been
			converted into a 30x30 grayscale image. The values of the pixels
			has been flattened row by row.

The dataset is freely available for research purposes. If you use it, please consider
