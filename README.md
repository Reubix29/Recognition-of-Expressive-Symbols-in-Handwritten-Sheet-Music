# Recognition-of-Expressive-Symbols-in-Handwritten-Sheet-Music
This is the repository for my honours project at the North West University, which explores the recognition of articulation, dynamics, ornamentation and music term symbols in handwritten sheet music.

The dataset used is based on the [MUSIMA++ dataset](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/muscima).
